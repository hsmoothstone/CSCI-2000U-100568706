To get the CSV file for part 2, i used LibreOffice. First I copied the columns
i wanted into a new spreadsheet, then i clicked save as and chose the
file type .csv

To choose the radii in part 2 i just multiplied all the radius values for each
disease by a constant so that the largest radius for each disease was 
roughly the same size.
