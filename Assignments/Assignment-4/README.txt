To get the CSV file for part 2, i used LibreOffice. First I copied the columns
i wanted into a new spreadsheet, then i clicked save as and chose the
file type .csv

To choose the radii in part 2 i just multiplied all the radius values for each
disease by a constant so that the largest radius for each disease was 
roughly the same size.

Also, for part 2, I noticed  that some of the data was not good. The csv file
i had was not correct and i had to go through it and manually fix
some mistakes in it(extra quotes, spaces and lines) before my program
would work.
